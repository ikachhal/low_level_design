What is the State Pattern?
The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state 
changes. It's like the object changes its class dynamically.

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state 
changes. It's like the object changes its class dynamically.

Key Components:
Context – the main class whose behavior changes with state.
State Interface – defines methods that concrete states must implement.
Concrete States – classes that implement behavior for a particular state.

Real-World Analogy:
Traffic Light – the light has states: Red, Green, Yellow. The behavior (what happens when a timer ends) depends on the 
current state. The logic for each is separate and interchangeable.
